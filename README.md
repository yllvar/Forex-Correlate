Forex-Correlate is a project that analyzes the correlation between various forex currency pairs. The primary focus is on the `correlation analysis.ipynb` notebook, which provides a comprehensive analysis of how different currency pairs move in relation to each other.

## Overview

Understanding currency correlations is crucial for forex traders, as it helps in risk management and strategy development. Currencies can exhibit positive, negative, or no correlation, influencing trading decisions. For instance, a strong positive correlation means that two currency pairs often move in the same direction, while a strong negative correlation indicates they move in opposite directions. 

## Features

- **Data Collection**: The notebook fetches historical exchange rate data for multiple currency pairs.

- **Correlation Calculation**: It computes the correlation coefficients between different currency pairs to determine their relationships.

- **Visualization**: The results are presented using heatmaps and other plots to provide a clear understanding of the correlations.
